# xAI-Flask-Interface
A simple Flask GUI to send requests to xAI and receive responses.
Notice that an xAI user is required (obviously), along with an API key. Below are the instructions to link between the API and the Flask application.

## Instructions for .env

1. Copy .env.example's contents.
2. Create an .env file, paste into it.
3. Replace the placeholder values with your actual configuration (API key).
